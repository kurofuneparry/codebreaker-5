# codebreaker-5

# 1 - Preview of the 5th step

# Final Conclusion:
- Review the game as created
- Review the syllabus goals for learning
  - All 8 elements of coding
    - With an emphasis on arrays and loops
    - Some fancy functions
      - Recursive
      - side effects
      - no side effects
      - default parameters
  - Computational thinking
    - Separation of concerns
    - AI approach considering various types of problems
  - Procedural programming makes it look a little messy
    - This isn't the dominant way to think about programming
    - But it's a sensible starting point
    - Other projects will help develop more style of programming
    - This will help you think about problems in more powerful ways
- Important new takeaways
  - Spatient and temporal complexity
    - This code isn't very efficient
      - It keeps recalculating allCodes and allResponses, so we could save those results
    - The exponential size of more colors and more dots in a code
      - This can grow impossibly large
    - Even if this is recoded to take up limited space, the time is too much
      - This is an open problem in computer science, what problems are quickly solvable?
        - Now that you're a programmer, you get why this can be a problem
    - What possible solutions exist?
      - Timed, limited execution?
      - Don't consider every code, but just a smart selection of codes
  - Downfalls of procedural programming
    - Not very clear reading through, even when carefully organized
    - Hard for people to work together
    - Need to very intentionally keep track of the state of variables
      - Functional programming doesn't use states, and avoids side effects
    - Have to think carefully about a separation of concerns
      - Object oriented programming keeps things separate by making objects separate things
    - Ultimately the strongest style of programming is adapted to your situation based on experience
  - Abstraction is key
    - Build tools that solve the little problems so that the big problem is now small
- And always have fun
- Introduce the two other coding projects
